# Changelog

### April 13, 2025

- Scrapped the original catalog idea for LA Hike Trails — it was starting to feel too much like a clone of AllTrails, lacking originality and personal touch.

- Pivoted to a new concept: a catalog of `Horizon (Zero Dawn / Forbidden West)` machines. This shift makes the project both unique and more meaningful to me, as it's based on a game I genuinely enjoy and couldn't find a dedicated catalog-style site for.

### April 10, 2025

- Reorganized file structure and created necessary directories
- Collected, cleaned, and added hiking data to the catalog
- Added notes.md to document thoughts and track progress
